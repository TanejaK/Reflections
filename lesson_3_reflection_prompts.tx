When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because 1 change might requires multiple commits, so if automatically gets updated
then there is chance that our file was not ready by then. In addition to that there can be multiple
 commits related to single logical change which we might wanted to have in single commit only.
