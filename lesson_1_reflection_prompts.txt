How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Its very less time consuming.
     If there was no diff, then, it would have been a lot difficult to manage different versions of our files.
     I mean I cannot read thousands of line of code and compare them manually.
     That is not a good practice and not practical to do.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If I made some changes to the file that was not correct, then I can change them or revert them according to the history only.
    It can also help one to compare their progress on the work they are doing.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
    Can commit according to the functionality, i.e. will commit whenever it is required and not something which is
    scheduled.
    Differentiating my commits according to the functionality changed.
    My code wont get committed in the middle of making some changes because it was scheduled.

    Cons:
    I have to remember to make the commits.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is more focussed towards code, and since files are interrelated to each other,
    it allows to commit multiple files at once. As in change of code means functionality change and That
    might needs to be updated at multiple locations. While on the other hand google docs is a rich editor
    which was not developed specifically for code. Its a normal editor and i.e needs multiple commits.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log can be used to view the history of changes made with each commit showing a message for what changes
    were made in that particular commit.
    Git diff can be used to see what changes were made in 2 versions of the same file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can make changes more confidently now since i know i can move back and fix any issues if they got introduced
    due to some changes made by me in any of the commits.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
